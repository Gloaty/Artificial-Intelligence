This text file is a reminder to myself that the project need to be contained within
a .ipynb file, since the jupyter environment appears to be more suited to the branch
of machine learning

This project, in total, is simply 1 image classification artificial intelligence
contained within a single file, opposed to multuiple files for different image sets. 

I wish to give this a GUI interface, so I'll need to do some research on whether tkinter
can work in a jupyter notebook. I'll create a few .ipynb files imitating those of the 
same name, but with the .py file extension. 

The work shall be performed in those files, and git shall get steady updates on the status
of the project, so I'll need to keep up witht that. 

After I've fully written my thoughts in this .txt file, I'll push the folder and its 
changes to git, so i dont have to worry about it for a while. Supposedly there are 156
files to be pushed to git, but i doubt that. It is feasibly possible, because i did change
the file organization in the overall folder, so it is possible. 

Gloaty, logging off and pushing to git
